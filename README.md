This repository contains a VBScript example demonstrating a common issue with the GetObject function and its improved, more robust solution.  The original code could fail if the target COM object (e.g., Excel) wasn't already running. The improved version first attempts to get the existing object and if that fails, it creates a new instance. This prevents unexpected script termination.
